This project involved conducting a descriptive analysis to uncover insights on the company’s performance, discover weak spots, and recommend areas for improvement. The company sells various electronic products in five different zones: South East, South South, South West, North Central, North East, North West, and FCT. The company has different sales channels and runs various sales promotions. The company wants to increase its revenue by making the best use of its resources. The goal is to provide the company with valuable insights and recommendations that will solve their problem.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The electronics company wants to know the following:
• The zone that is most profitable
• The promotion with the highest sales
• The least profitable sales channel
• The sales trend of previous years

# DATA PROCESSING
The data was transformed using the Power Query Editor.
Inconsistent data were handled; I checked for missing values; the data type issues were handled; and the data was complete and ready to use for analysis.

# DATA MODELING
I created a relationship to enable me to connect the different tables to each other. This makes it possible to interact with variables from the different tables. A snowflake schema approach was adopted here.

# PROJECT TASK ;
1) Which zone makes the most profit?
2) What promotions return the highest sales?
3) What sales channel is least profitable?
4) What is the sales trend?
